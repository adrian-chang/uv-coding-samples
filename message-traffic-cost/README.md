Question: Greedy Traffic Maximization via Messaging
Problem Statement:

Attentive wants to drive traffic to its clients' websites by sending personalized messages to users. Each message has an associated cost and is expected to generate a certain amount of traffic (e.g., clicks or visits). However, there are constraints:

The total cost of all messages sent cannot exceed a given budget.
No user can receive more than one message in a given time period to avoid spamming.
Your task is to implement a function maximize_traffic_greedy that selects the optimal set of messages to send in order to maximize the total traffic generated, subject to the constraints.

You are given:

A list of messages, where each message contains:
user_id: The unique identifier for the user.
cost: The cost of sending the message to this user.
traffic: The expected traffic (e.g., clicks or visits) generated by sending the message to this user.
An integer budget, representing the maximum total cost allowed for sending messages.
Your goal is to return:

The maximum total traffic that can be generated.
The list of user_ids for which messages should be sent to achieve this maximum traffic.

Example:

````
messages = [
    {"user_id": 1, "cost": 10, "traffic": 60},
    {"user_id": 2, "cost": 20, "traffic": 100},
    {"user_id": 3, "cost": 30, "traffic": 120},
    {"user_id": 4, "cost": 15, "traffic": 80},
    {"user_id": 5, "cost": 25, "traffic": 90}
]
budget = 50

{'max_traffic': 240, 'selected_users': [1, 4, 2]}
```

Explanation:

Sending messages to users 2 and 4 costs 20 + 15 = 35, which is within the budget of 50.
The total traffic generated is 100 + 80 = 180.
